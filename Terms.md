# Support

Awesome Support being a free software, there is no guarantee that you will receive support for it.

After downloading the plugin you will have access to a free support forum where you can ask your questions, report bugs, ask for assistance and share your ideas. We will do our best to satisfy your requests but keep in mind that we might ask you to purchase priority support if we reckon that your request requires extra attention.

In case you have purchased an add-on from our catalog, you will be entitled to 12 (twelve) month of priority support for the add-on you purchased or for any issue related to the Awesome Support plugin.

Access to priority support is subject to the condition that you own a license that is valid and active (see hereafter the "Licensing" paragraph). If your license is expired, you must renew your license key, purchase priority support access, or purchase a new license for the extension you wish to get support for.

## Particular Cases

### E-Mail Notifications

If you are encountering issues with the e-mail notification feature, we will only be able to assist you, be it through free or premium support, if and only if you are using a transactional e-mail service provider (ESP) that provides details on outbound e-mails.

If you are using the default `mail()` function of PHP (through the WordPress wrapper function `wp_mail()` or not) or a WordPress SMTP plugin, we will **not** be able to assist you with this particular matter.

# Licensing

Licenses are valid for one year from the date of purchase. A valid and active license key is required in order to get updates and support for purchased extensions and themes. After one year, license keys may be renewed at a 20% discount from the purchase price of a new license.

# Software Updates

Updates are included for free for one year. If you have a valid and active license key, and your extension(s) supports it, updates will be delivered automatically from the WordPress dashboard. If your extension(s) does not support automatic upgrades, then updates can be downloaded from your account page.

# Refunds

If you have problems getting extensions to work, we will be happy to provide a full refund within 30 days of the original purchase. After 30 days, no refunds will be given. Before a refund will be granted, you must allow us to try and help solve any problem you have by opening a support ticket.

**NOTE:** refunds will not be granted if you simply decide not to use the purchased products. We stand behind our products and will assist you in solving any problem you have, but we also expect you to adequately understand what you are purchasing and why.
